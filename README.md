# Key Findings:
The blood tests Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) and Gamma Glutamyl Transferase (GGT)  are the most effective at estimating alcohol consumption.

# Research Questions
Main Research Question: Which Blood tests are good predictors that a physician might use to inform their diagnosis?</br>

Created Research Question: Is MCV a strong predictor for chronic alcohol consumption, and is it useful in the diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease?

# Lessons learned and recommendation
A simple model with only the two key tests (MCV & GGT) is much more effective in producing reliable results and easier to understand than using all variables.</br>

It is recommended that medical professionals use MCV and GGT in their diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease.

# Limitations and what can be improved
## Limitations:
- Strict deadlines for certain sections to be reviewed
- Defined set of methods to be used 
- Set format and reference
</br>

## What can be improved:
- Interpretation should include missing core model information 
- Strengthen interpretation of descriptive statistics 
- Add simple linear regression
- Present & interpret coefficients, significance and F-test results
</br>
